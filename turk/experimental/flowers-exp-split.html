      <p class="block-text"><br>Welcome to Gamma-4-5a in a galaxy far, far away. We have encountered an intelligent alien life form with its own form of language. You must try to learn this language as best as you can.<br><br>
      Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed -- the alien knows that this is a difficult task for you to master, and it will do its best to understand everything that you say. <br><br> Click the Continue button to proceed.</p>

    </div>

    <!--SECOND INSTRUCTIONS SLIDE-->
    <div class="slide" id="secondInstructions">
      <p class="block-text"><br>You will see a series of flowers and the way in which the alien would describe those flowers. You will also be asked to make a judgment on if the flower is poisonous and you will be provided feedback on whether your judgment was correct. Every now and then the alien will test your knowledge of the language by showing you a flower without any description. Simple write what you think the correct response is in the input box provided.<br><br>
      <b><u>Don't worry if you feel you have not yet mastered the language!</u></b><br><br>
      The most important thing is to maintain good relations with the aliens and give it your best shot. <b><u>Always give an answer.</u></b> That way the aliens will know you are trying. They will go out of their way to try to understand everything you say, and they are very patient. <br><br>
      You will be given a break every 5 minutes or so. <br><br>
      Good luck!
