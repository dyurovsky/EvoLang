      <p class="block-text"><br>Welcome to Gamma-4-5a in a galaxy far, far away. We have encountered an intelligent alien life form with its own form of language. You must try to learn this language as best as you can.<br><br>
      Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed -- the alien knows that this is a difficult task for you to master, and it will do its best to understand everything that you say. <br><br> Click the Continue button to proceed.</p>

    <!--SECOND INSTRUCTIONS SLIDE-->
    <div class="slide" id="secondInstructions">
      <p class="block-text"><br>You will see a series of flowers and the way in which the alien would describe those flowers. Every now and then the alien will test your knowledge of the language by showing you a flower without any description. Simple write what you think the correct response is in the input box provided.<br><br>
      <b><u>Don't worry if you feel you have not yet mastered the language!</u></b><br><br>
      The most important thing is to maintain good relations with the aliens and give it your best shot. <b><u>Always give an answer.</u></b> That way the aliens will know you are trying. They will go out of their way to try to understand everything you say, and they are very patient. <br><br>
      You will be given a break every 5 minutes or so. <br><br>
      Good luck!
